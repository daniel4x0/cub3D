My first RayCaster with miniLibX!

Summary: This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which was the first FPS ever. It enabled me to explore ray-casting. My goal was to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which the player will have to find his way.

I collaborated with a fellow student who worked on all cases of parsing the map while i worked on the ray-casting aspect. The DDA Algorithm was used and i got numerous resources from all over the internet but mainly followed this guide: https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html.

The original inspiration of our project can be played here: http://users.atw.hu/wolf3d/. Other elements like weapons, minimap, doors and a score board will be added soon ;)

Enjoy!
